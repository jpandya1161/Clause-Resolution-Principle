Theorem prover for a clause logic using the resolution principle.

Implemented a python program that proves whether a clause is entailed by a knowledge base.

Uses the resolution principle to prove a clause is valid by contradiction.

Negates the clause to be proved and add it to the knowledge base, then deduces new clauses until contradiction or until no new clauses can be generated.
